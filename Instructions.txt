l>14;Quarto is played on a 4x4 board. There
l>14;are 16 pieces, each of which has four
l>14;attributes:
l>11;   Tall or Short
l>11;   Round or Square
l>11;   Dark or Light
l>11;   Flat or Hollow
p>
l>14;Players take turns selecting any of
l>14;the available pieces.  Once a piece is
l>14;selected, the player gives the piece to
l>14;his/her opponent who plays it in any of
l>14;the available positions on the board. 
p>
l>14;The winning player is the first player
l>14;to create a row or diagonal which
l>14;contains any four pieces that share a 
l>14;common attribute. (ie: 4 dark pieces or
l>14;4 short pieces, 4 round pieces, etc).
p>
l>14;The winning player need not have played
l>14;all four of the winning pieces.  He/she 
l>14;need only to place the final piece.  
l>14;Sounds easy?  Good luck!
l>14; 
l>14;Enjoy!
